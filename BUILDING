Building From Checkout
======================

You only need to follow these instructions if you are building from a direct
repository checkout. If you are installing CouchDB from a tarball you can skip
to the installation section in the `README` file.

You will need the following installed:

 * GNU Automake (>=1.6.3) (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
 * GNU Autoconf (>=2.59)  (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
 * GNU Libtool            (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
 * GNU help2man           (http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/)

The `help2man` tool is optional, but will generate `man` pages for you.

Debian-based (inc. Ubuntu) Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install the dependencies by running:

    apt-get install automake autoconf libtool help2man

Be sure to update the version numbers to match your system's available packages.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

You can install the dependencies by running:

    port install automake autoconf libtool help2man

You will need MacPorts installed to use the `port` command.

Bootstrapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bootstrap the pristine source by running:

    ./bootstrap

You must repeat this step every time you update your checkout.
